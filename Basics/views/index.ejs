            <p>Styling links as buttons
                The tools you've explored so far in this article can also be used in other ways. For example, states
                like hover can be used to style many different elements, not just links â€” you might want to style the
                hover state of paragraphs, list items, or other things.

                In addition, links are quite commonly styled to look and behave like buttons in certain circumstances. A
                website navigation menu is usually marked up as a list containing links, and this can be easily styled
